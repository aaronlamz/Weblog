# Getting Started with Weblog

Welcome to Weblog! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring your own blog using this template.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live demo at [ultimate-kernel.fun/Weblog](https://www.ultimate-kernel.fun/Weblog/)

![Weblog Preview](https://api.microlink.io?url=https://www.ultimate-kernel.fun/Weblog/&screenshot=true&meta=false&embed=screenshot.url)

This demo showcases:
- Clean and modern design
- Dark/Light mode support
- Bilingual support (English/Chinese)
- Responsive layout
- Frosted glass navigation
- Tech stack carousel
- Blog with tags and archive

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronlamz/Weblog.git
cd Weblog
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your site should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`!

## Configuration

### Basic Site Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `src/config/site.config.ts`. Here are the key sections you'll want to customize:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: 'Your Site Name',
  title: 'Your Site Title',
  description: 'Your site description',
  
  author: {
    name: 'Your Name',
    email: 'your.email@example.com',
    avatar: 'https://github.com/yourusername.png', // GitHub avatar or any image URL
    bio: 'Your short bio',
  },
  
  social: {
    github: 'https://github.com/yourusername',
    twitter: 'https://twitter.com/yourusername',
    email: 'your.email@example.com',
  }
}
```

### Setting Up Comments with Giscus

Weblog uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app) for comments, which is powered by GitHub Discussions. Here's how to set it up:

1. Make sure your repository is public
2. Enable GitHub Discussions in your repository:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to "Features"
   - Check "Discussions"

3. Install the [Giscus GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/giscus)
   - Visit the Giscus app page
   - Click "Install"
   - Select your repository

4. Get your Giscus configuration:
   - Visit [giscus.app](https://giscus.app)
   - Enter your repository information
   - Copy the generated configuration

5. Update the Giscus configuration in `src/components/comments.tsx`:
```typescript
<Giscus
  repo="yourusername/yourrepo"
  repoId="your-repo-id"
  category="Announcements"
  categoryId="your-category-id"
  mapping="pathname"
  theme={theme === 'dark' ? 'dark_dimmed' : 'light'}
  lang={locale === 'zh' ? 'zh-CN' : 'en'}
/>
```

### Internationalization (i18n)

Weblog supports both English and Chinese out of the box. The translations are stored in:
- `messages/en.json` for English
- `messages/zh.json` for Chinese

To add or modify translations:

1. Add your text to both language files
2. Use the translation keys in your components:
```typescript
const t = useTranslations('namespace')
// ...
<div>{t('key')}</div>
```

### Writing Blog Posts

Blog posts are written in MDX and stored in:
- `content/blog/en/` for English posts
- `content/blog/zh/` for Chinese posts

Each post should include frontmatter:
```mdx
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A brief description"
date: "2024-03-20"
featured: false
---

Your content here...
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1. Update `next.config.js`:
```javascript
const basePath = process.env.BASE_PATH || ''
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

const nextConfig = {
  output: isProduction ? 'export' : undefined,
  basePath: isProduction ? basePath : '',
}
```

2. Configure GitHub Actions:
   - The workflow file is already set up in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
   - Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

3. Push your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for deployment"
git push
```

Your site will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages!

## Customization

### Styling

Weblog uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The main configuration files are:
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind configuration
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Global styles
- Individual component styles are written using Tailwind classes

### Components

Key components you might want to customize:
- `src/components/header.tsx` - Navigation and site header
- `src/components/footer.tsx` - Site footer
- `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx` - Dark/light mode toggle
- `src/components/language-switcher.tsx` - Language switcher

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
- Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aaronlamz/Weblog/issues)
- Create a new issue if you can't find a solution
- Join the discussion in GitHub Discussions

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
